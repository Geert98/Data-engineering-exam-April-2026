# This script is the main orchestration entry point for the full project pipeline.
#
# It connects all pipeline components into one end-to-end workflow.
#
# The script:
# 1. loads environment variables
# 2. sets up logging
# 3. loads the shared configuration
# 4. ensures required directories exist
# 5. runs data ingestion
# 6. runs preprocessing
# 7. runs feature engineering
# 8. trains the model
# 9. generates the latest prediction
# 10. generates the static GitHub Pages report
#
# In practice, this file is the easiest way to execute the full pipeline locally.
# It is also useful as the baseline command behind automation, scheduling,
# or API-triggered execution.

    Run the full pipeline from ingestion to prediction and report generation.

    Why this function exists:
    - The project consists of multiple modular scripts, each handling one stage
      of the MLOps pipeline.
    - This function stitches them together into one reproducible end-to-end run.
    - It provides a simple single command for local execution, testing,
      automation, and scheduled runs.

    Pipeline order
    --------------
    1. Load environment variables
    2. Configure logging
    3. Load config and create required directories
    4. Ingest structured FRED data
    5. Ingest unstructured news data
    6. Preprocess raw news
    7. Build the monthly feature table
    8. Train the baseline model
    9. Generate the latest prediction
    10. Generate the static GitHub Pages report
