# This script is responsible for generating the latest prediction from the
# trained model artifacts.
#
# In the pipeline, this file is used after model training and feature engineering.
# It loads:
# - the latest model-ready feature table
# - the saved trained model pipeline
# - the saved feature column list
#
# It then:
# 1. selects the most recent available row in the feature table
# 2. applies the trained model to that row
# 3. extracts class probabilities
# 4. saves the result as a prediction artifact
#
# This prediction artifact is later consumed by the FastAPI service and
# the Streamlit dashboard.

def predict_latest(config_path: str = "configs/config.yaml") -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Generate a prediction for the latest available feature row.

    Why this function exists:
    - The project needs a reusable prediction step that can run after training.
    - The prediction output should be stored as an artifact so it can be served
      by the API and displayed in the frontend.
    - The function uses the exact same feature columns and preprocessing pipeline
      that were used during training.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config_path : str
        Path to the YAML configuration file.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        A one-row DataFrame containing:
        - month
        - predicted_next_month_pressure
        - proba_low
        - proba_medium
